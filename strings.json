		"info": "This bot will analyze your tree (from the Grow A Tree Bot by Limbo Labs) and compare its growth to other trees displayed on the leaderboard.\n\nThis bot assumes that there is a single `/tree` message and a single `/top trees` message that everyone uses. If everyone creates their own `/tree` and `/top trees`, the reference messages will have to be updated every time, or old data will be displayed.\n\nGrow A Tree Analyzer is not affiliated with Grow A Tree Bot or Limbo Labs in any way.",
		"setup": "To begin analyzing your Tree, first you must set up the reference messages.\n\n1. Reply to your server's `/tree` message with `.settree`.\n  • Analyzer will DM you to confirm that the `/tree` message has been set correctly.\n2. Now reply to your server's `/top trees` message with `.setranks`.\n  • Analyzer will send you a DM to confirm that the `/top trees` message has been set correctly.\n3. Now simply run `/compare` where you want your analysis to be visible.",
		"permissions": "At a minimum, Grow A Tree Analyzer requires permissions to `Send Messages` and `Send Messages in Threads` if applicable. If Analyzer is given permission to `Manage Messages`, the bot will delete the `.settree` and `.setranks` messages to reduce spam."
