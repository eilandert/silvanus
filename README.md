#Grow A Tree Analyzer
This bot works with Grow A Tree Bot by Limbo Labs. This project is not affiliated with Limbo Labs in any way.

This bot allows easy comparison between a server's tree and other trees displayed on the leaderboard.

##Usage
Add the bot to your server and make sure it has the proper permissions (`Send Messages` and `Send Messages in Threads` if applicable), then run `/setup` in the channel(s) that contain your server's tree and leaderboard messages.

##Commands

* `/setup` - Attempts automatic detection of your server's tree and leaderboard messages.
* `/setupinfo` - Displays your server's current configuration.
* `/reset` - Resets your server's configuration, run `/setup` again if needed.
